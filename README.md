# Simulation_puzzle_planner

A project for cisc813<br>
The term simulation puzzle refers to a conversational game based on a defined constraint of topics. The game involves two participants. The first participant(story maker) will think of a story/event and provide the start and result/end of the story. The second participant (questioner) needs to ask a series of questions to the first participant about the details of the story, and then make the guess. The questions have to and can only be answered with yes or no.
