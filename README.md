# Simulation_puzzle_planner

A project for cisc813<br>
The term simulation puzzle refers to a conversational game based on a defined constraint of topics. The game involves two participants. The first participant(story maker) will think of a story/event and provide the start and result/end of the story. The second participant (questioner) needs to ask a series of questions to the first participant about the details of the story, and then make the guess. The questions have to and can only be answered with yes or no.

current progress:
Simple simualtion model, with given conditions and assume the machine can do the natural language processing

Next step:
Extend the model on rddl or pddl to more complex model, including the :)observe option on viewing user responses and state representation on user reponse.
The probaiblity of geting valid information for a given state could be extended to a loop containing various actions.
